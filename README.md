# Tadarab
This project develops "Tadarab," a mobile app using Android Studio to connect university students with internship opportunities. Tadarab lets users find training organizations, share achievements, and rate experiences. Organizations can post opportunities and review trainee profiles, fostering collaboration and enhancing internship experiences.
